# Code2040 Technical Assessment - Issac Holguin

Code I wrote for Code2040's Fellowman's Program Application. Each file corresponds to each step.

I chose Python because it was the most straighforward language to read and understand what exactly is going on. I know that's what comments are for, but I like my code to speak for itself :)

Cheers!
Issac James Holguin
